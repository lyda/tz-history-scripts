Contents: what, why, how, decisions / issues

== What? ==

This is a collection of scripts and data which can be used to construct
a metadata preserving git repository of all the zoneinfo releases
since 1986.

== Why? ==

On that note let me say a huge thank you to the combined half a century
of work that Paul and Arthur and everyone else has contributed here.
It is out of respect for the work everyone has done here that I've tried
to create a faithful reproduction of the work you have all given to us.

Last year I read
http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/10/23/a-literary-appreciation-of-the-olsonzoneinfotz-database/
and was hugely impressed by the quiet work we all take for granted.
So hearing about the current issues the maintainers are having I didn't
want the history to be lost.

== How? ==

* See the */FETCH_DATA files and gather the required data.
* See work-usenix/ directory for how to generate the original git.settz
  repository.
* Continue on in the work/ directory (there's a script there to copy
  the git.settz repository.

== Decisions / Issues ==

These scripts make a number of decisions people could debate.  I have
listed them here so that others could review.

1)  I date each commit based on the date of the message announcing the
    release.  It's possible to extract an arguably more accurate date from
    the files within the repository but since the commit message is based
    on the release message, it was my opinion that date was more correct.

2)  The following files are referred to in the tzarchive (thank you IANA
    for hosting the archive and to GMANE for filling in the blanks).
    I'm pretty sure all of these existed.

      tzcode1998.tar.gz   tzcode2002a.tar.gz  tzcode2006e.tar.gz
      tzcode2008e.tar.tz  tzcode2010b.tar.gz  tzcode93g.tar.gz
      tzcode94b.tar.gz    tzcode94c.tar.gz    tzcode94d.tar.gz
      tzcode94e.tar.gz    tzcode94f.tar.gz    tzcode94g.tar.gz
      tzcode94h.tar.gz    tzcode95a.tar.gz    tzcode95b.tar.gz
      tzcode95c.tar.gz    tzcode95f.tar.gz    tzcode96e.tar.gz
      tzcode96f.tar.gz    tzcode96k.tar.gz    tzdata1996m.tar.gz
      tzdata1998f.tar.gz  tzdata1998g.tar.gz  tzdata2002a.tar.gz
      tzdata2006e.tar.gz  tzdata93g.tar.gz    tzdata94a.tar.gz
      tzdata94b.tar.gz    tzdata94d.tar.gz    tzdata94e.tar.gz
      tzdata94f.tar.gz    tzdata94h.tar.gz    tzdata95a.tar.gz
      tzdata95b.tar.gz    tzdata95j.tar.gz    tzdata96f.tar.gz
      tzdata96g.tar.gz

    Notes from reviewing the missing files:

      tzcode94c.tar.gz - can be recreated with
                         <9402101356.AA19044@elsie.nci.nih.gov>
      tzcode94e.tar.gz - might be recreatable w/
                         <9403310434.AA22475@elsie.nci.nih.gov>
      tzcode95a.tar.gz may be bogus
      Possibly missing: betatzcode.tar.gz betatzdata.tar.gz
                        classictzcode.tar.gz classictzdata.tar.gz
                        (they go just before tzcode95a.tar.gz)
      tzcode96k.tar.gz - not bogus but might have been pulled?
                         <9609082035.AA12565@elsie.nci.nih.gov>
                         <9609082115.AA12896@elsie.nci.nih.gov>
      tzdata94a.tar.gz - recreatable with
                         <9402031404.AA26306@elsie.nci.nih.gov>

3)  The tzcode and tzdata files are in the same directory - that's
    how they initially started in 1986.  One could argue that starting
    with releases in 1993 that the code and data should be broken out
    into different directories.

4)  Each commit message has the Message-Id header of the message it
    came from.  That can be used to find the messages and related threads
    in mailing list archives in the future.

5)  For the Usenet files:

      * It's possible there was a release prior to:
        comp.sources.unix/volume4/settz
      * It's possible (likely?) there were releases between:
        comp.sources.unix/volume14/localtime3
        comp.sources.unix/volume18/localtime3

6)  Credits.  All the commits (except the last (currently) by kre)
    are credited to ado.  However in his commit messages he will
    frequently credit others - eggert primarily.  It's possible this
    info is in SCCS but I doubt it.
