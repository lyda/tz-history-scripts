This is a work in progress.  It is entirely possible that I will blow
it all away and start over.  I will detail the decisions I've made, explain
what might be missing and what could be done differently.

First let me say a huge thank you to the combined half a century of work
that Paul and Arthur and everyone else has contributed here.  It is out
of respect for the work everyone has done here that I've tried to create
a faithful reproduction of the work you have all given to us.

Last year I read
http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/10/23/a-literary-appreciation-of-the-olsonzoneinfotz-database/
and was hugely impressed by the quiet work we all take for granted.

Now to the problems:

1)  I date each commit based on the date of the message announcing the
    release.  It's possible to extract an arguably more accurate date from
    the files within the repository but since the commit message is based
    on the release message, it was my opinion that date was more correct.

2)  [Update: redid this with --allow-empty for the git commit step.
     But I'll leave it here to highlight the oddity of the files being the
     same...]

    The files in tzdata1998i.tar tzdata1999a.tar are the same.  Therefore
    this commit message is missing (however the tag is there):

      Tue, 19 Jan 1999 16:26:44 -0500
      tzcode1999a.tar.gz and tzdata1999a.tar.gz
      Message-ID: <43E124CC389ED111B18D00805FEA1E63BC4C7A@nihexchange2.nih.gov>

      The files
              ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode1999a.tar.gz
      and
              ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata1999a.tar.gz
      are now available. These include error message internationalizations and
      corrections in zic.c and zdump.c (as suggested by Vladimir Michl,
      vladimir.michl at upol.cz, to whom thanks!)

                                              --ado

3)  The following files are referred to in the tzarchive (thank you IANA
    for hosting the archive and to GMANE for filling in the blanks).
    I'm not sure if they actually existed and weren't copied to
    ftp://munnari.oz.au/pub/oldtz or if they were typos or people
    wondering about skipped letters.

      tzdata1996m.tar.gz
      tzdata1997h.tar.gz
      tzdata1998f.tar.gz
      tzdata1998g.tar.gz
      tzdata2002a.tar.gz
      tzdata2003b.tar.gz
      tzdata2005a.tar.gz
      tzdata2006e.tar.gz
      tzdata93g.tar.gz
      tzdata93.tar.Z
      tzdata94a.tar.gz
      tzdata94b.tar.gz
      tzdata94d.tar.gz
      tzdata94e.tar.gz
      tzdata94f.tar.gz
      tzdata94h.tar.gz
      tzdata95a.tar.gz
      tzdata95b.tar.gz
      tzdata95j.tar.gz
      tzdata96f.tar.gz
      tzdata96g.tar.gz

    If people have any leads on these I can rerun this.

4)  I chose a directory structure that would allow me to also add the
    tzcode base to this repository.  So the tzdata files are not at the
    base but in the tzdata subdirectory.

5)  Each commit message has the Message-Id header of the message it
    came from.  I think that can be used to find the messages and related
    threads in mailing list archives in the future.

6)  I'm happy to release the data I used to create this.  A lot of the
    data massaging had to be done by hand but I can write up the various
    command lines I used.  It's kind of boring though really.

I hope this doesn't annoy people.  I just want to help preserve the
history of an incredible effort.
