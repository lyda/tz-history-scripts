pre-commit.chk-sccs-id:
  This is a pre-commit hook to make sure any file with an expanded "%W%"
  style SCCS id string is properly incrementing.

  Only the first version number is compared.  Nothing else really makes
  sense as lines can be moved around and it would be hard to know which
  line:version tuple to compare between the file in HEAD and the file
  in the index.

  It has one configuration option: sccs.exclude-lines.  Lines with this
  string are excluded from the search for the "@(#)filename\tversion"
  string that the version number is found with in the current and
  changed files.

  For the zoneinfo project, one would run this command to exclude the
  older Berkeley SCCS id number that a few files include:

    git config sccs.exclude-lines Berkeley

  To install the hook, just copy pre-commit.chk-sccs-id to
  ../work/git.tz/.git/hook/pre-commit
