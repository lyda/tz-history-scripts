This is the new home for the tz mailing list.  It contains all the tz
archives from the beginning to July, 2011.  It has all the new messages
sent to the list.

Web address: https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz

The following commands should build a suitable tzarchive up to July 2011:

  wget https://mm.icann.org/mailman/listinfo/tz
  for f in $(grep txt.gz index.html | sed 's/.*="//;s/".*//'); do
    wget http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/$f
  done
  for f in $(grep txt.gz * | sed 's/.*="//;s/".*//' | tac); do
    zcat $f
  done > ../list/tzarchive
