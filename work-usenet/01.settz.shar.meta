Please send comments or information to seismo!elsie!ado (with,
perhaps, carbon copes to cbosgd!mark, seismo!linus!encore!necis!geo,
and seismo!munnari!kre, who are responsible for any good ideas that show
up here).

Historical local time information has been included here not because
it should be part of the standard (or, indeed, anyone's product), but
rather to:

* give people an idea of the variety of local time rules that have 
  existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be 
  expected in the future; 
* provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
  system.
