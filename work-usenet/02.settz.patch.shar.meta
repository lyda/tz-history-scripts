Updates to "settz" data files (settz.patch)
mod.sources-v06i070

On July 8, Ronald Reagan signed a bill changing the United States' Daylight
Saving Time law.

Starting in 1987, US Daylight Saving is to be observed from the *first* Sunday
in April until the last Sunday in October.  (Under recent law, it has been
observed from the *last* Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October.)

Here are updated versions of two data files that were part of the recently
posted time zone package.
