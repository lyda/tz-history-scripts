Public Domain (Table Driven) ``localtime''
mod.sources-v09i021

Description:
	This is patch #1 for the public domain localtime.

	It fixes the following problems (in decreasing order of severity):

	1) The "timezone" variable, defined when USG_COMPAT is defined
	   was being set to a value of the wrong sign (not compatible).

	2) asctime() did not guarantee zero filled 2 digit fields when
	   used with old versions of printf that cannot handle the "%.2d"
	   format specification.

	3) The STD_INSPIRED functions for converting "struct tm" values
	   to time_t's would fail when given a "struct tm" value that
	   was "illegal" (ie: not a possible output from localtime)
	   and which happen to occur just near the end of one of the
	   shorter months (the actual requirements are a little stricter
	   than this), or from timelocal or timeoff where the offset
	   moves the time from one month to another (where the earlier
	   month is one of the shorter ones).

	4) Missing rules for East Saskatchewan in Canada.

	5) Typos in the zic(8) manual page.

Fix:
	From your newsreading program, say "| patch -d DIR" where DIR
	is the directory where the pd-localtime distribution is saved.
	Alternatively, change to that directory, and do "patch -d . <newsitem".
	Recompile and re-install the library routines.  Recompile any
	programs using the STD_INSPIRED functions.  There is no need to
	recompile other programs unless the asctime output is incorrect.
	(nb: Patchlevel.h is a new file).
