These scripts are used to make the git.tz repository.  The git.tz
repository should initially be copied from the ../work-usenet/git.settz
repository.

  cp -a ../work-usenet/git.settz git.tz

Make sure that HEAD is checked out:

  ( cd git.tz && git co master )

If you'd rather ignore the initial history, just do this:

  mkdir git.tz
  ( cd git.tz && git init )

First copy and uncompress the tarballs (this will require the gunzip
and uncompress binaries):

  ./mktarballs.sh

The tarballs/ dir now contains the results.  If you want to limit the
git.tz repository to just code or just data, remove the tarballs you
don't want at this point.

Next build an index of the files (this sorts them in chronological order):

  ./mkindex.sh

Only the files in ./index will be put into the archive.

Next build the meta files.  You can use the files in the meta.saved/
directory that I have already processed.  However if you have new
tzdata/tzcode tarballs or if you have some ideas on how to get better
data, the mkmeta.sh script can generate the files.

Once the index file and the tarballs/ and meta/ directories are created
and populated just run the add.sh script:

  ./add.sh
