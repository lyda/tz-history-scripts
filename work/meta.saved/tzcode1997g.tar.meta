new time zone code and data files
Message-ID: <9709042106.AA01521@elsie.nci.nih.gov>

The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/~pub/tzcode1997g.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/~pub/tzdata1997h.tar.gz
are now available. These files incorporate the corrections for Uruguay
(and other locations) that were sent to the time zone mailing list last
week; they also incorporate your correspondent's simple-minded fix
allowing mktime to both correctly handle leap seconds and correctly
handle tm_sec values upon which arithmetic has been performed. (A
ponder of Tom Peterson's suggested optimizations to those changes is in
my queue.)
