The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode1999c.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata1999c.tar.gz
are now available. These include the changes circulated by Paul Eggert on the
time zone mailing list,
most importantly the change for Chile.

I tried and failed to reproduce the proglem reported by Andreas Jaeger; 
if anyone has insights please pass them on to both the time zone list and
Andreas (who's not on the list).
