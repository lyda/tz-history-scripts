The file
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2000d.tar.gz
is now available; tzdata2000d.tar.gz is unchanged. Included are changes to
the documentation and code of strftime
for C99 conformance, and a bug fix for date.c. These are based on (though
modified from) the changes circulated on the time zone mailing list by Paul
Eggert.

I'll wait on changes to Argentina until the smoke clears.
