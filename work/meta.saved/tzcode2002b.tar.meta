Correct (as far as I've been able to test) versions of the new time zone
stuff are now available as
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2002b.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2002b.tar.gz

(I still need to track down how the original versions got corrupted, but
have transferred the above by way of another path.)
