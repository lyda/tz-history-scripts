The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2002d.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2002d.tar.gz
are now available. They incorporate the changes circulated last week on the
time zone mailing list by Paul Eggert,
less the "Britain (UK)" change in iso3166.tab. There's also a new time zone
quote in "tz-art.htm."

Note that our lab is due to move from the third to the fourth floor of our
building this week;
some outages in the availability of elsie.nci.nih.gov are to be expected.
Download early.
