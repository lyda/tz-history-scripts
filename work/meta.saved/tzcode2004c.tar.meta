The file...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/tzcode2004c.tar.gz
...is now available; this includes the asctime-related changes circulated on
the time zone mailing list last week as well as (variants of) some of the
documentation changes suggested by Paul Eggert. No new data tarball has been
made available since none of the data tarball components have changed.
