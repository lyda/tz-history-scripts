The file...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2004d.tar.gz
...is now available. This incorporates the (now slightly modified) changes
circulated last week on the time zone mailing list to: make zic complain
about links to links if the -v flag is used; have "make public" do more code
checking; and add an include to "localtime.c" for the benefit of gcc
systems.

Note that there are no data changes.

Expect one more batch of delinting changes for the code.
