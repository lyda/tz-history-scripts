Tzcode2005k.tar.gz and tzdata2005k.tar.gz
Message-ID: <75DDD376F2B6B546B722398AC161106C740462@nihexchange2.nih.gov>

The files...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2005k.tar.gz
...and...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2005k.tar.gz
...are now available. The "leapseconds" file has been edited to reflect the
recently announced leap second at the end of 2005.
I've also deleted electronic mail addresses from the files as an anti-spam
measure.

I'm waiting to hear from the heavyweights before incorporating the recent
64-bit stuff (the new version that tacks both 64-bit data and a POSIX TZ
string on to the end of traditional timezone data files).
