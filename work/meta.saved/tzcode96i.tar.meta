If the full name is any indication, it dates from 1988.

The situation is akin to that of the C standard; it's copyrighted by the
issuing body. A summary is available; I've put a (recompressed) copy of it
in the ~ftp/pub directory on elsie.nci.nih.gov (165.112.73.1); see

It's dicey as to what the right thing to do is.
As long as we're deliberately making an error, we might as well err in
the same way as other major implementers. Paul's suggested patch is
incorporated into
