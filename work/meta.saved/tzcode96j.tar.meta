I'm forwarding the attached bug report with permisison from Timothy Patrick
Murphy; an updated version of the time zone code--

> I believe I have discovered a bug in the tzparse() function and would
> like you to review this.  When the value of the TZ environment
> variable is of the form JKL3:10PNM4:40 the section of code between
> lines 947 and 1031 in localtime.c are executed.  It seems that at the
> end of this block the value of sp->typecnt should be set to 2.  If
> this is not done and there are at least 2 entries in the ttis array
> such that tt_isdst is false then the value of the global timezone
> variable is corrupted on line 234 in the settzname() function.
