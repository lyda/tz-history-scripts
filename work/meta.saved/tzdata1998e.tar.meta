tzcode1998e.tar.gz and tzdata1998e.tar.gz
Message-ID: <9805281401.AA24340@elsie.nci.nih.gov>

The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode1998e.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata1998e.tar.gz
are now available. The Makefile is changed to produce
zoneinfo-posix rather than zoneinfo/posix, and to produce
zoneinfo-leaps rather than zoneinfo/right. The data changes
recently circulated by Paul Eggert on the time zone mailing list are
incorporated,
as are the changes from Guy Harris to provide asctime_r and ctime_r.
And a usno1998 file (substantially identical to usno1997) has been
added.
