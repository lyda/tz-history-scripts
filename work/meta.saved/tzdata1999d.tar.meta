The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode1999d.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata1999d.tar.gz
are now available. These include the changes circulated this week on the time
zone mailing list by Paul Eggert;
the Makefile's "make public" rule has also been changed to do a test compile of
each individual time zone data file
(which should help avoid problems such as the one we had with Nicosia).
