The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode1999e.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata1999e.tar.gz
are now available. These files incorporate the changes circulated last week by
Paul Eggert on the time zone mailing list,
although the change to handling of DST-specifying time zone names has been
commented out for now (search for "XXX" in "localtime.c" for details). These
files also do not make any changes to the start of DST in Brazil.

In addition to Paul's changes, there are updates to "Arts.htm" and cleanups of
URLs.

I imagine we'll see 1999f shortly with both changes in "localtime.c" and
"southamerica"; folks can judge whether to await 1999f before downloading.
