The files
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2001a.tar.gz
and
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2001a.tar.gz
are now available. These incorporate the changes circulated last week on the
time zone mailing list by Paul Eggert.
There's also an addition to the "leapseconds" file: comments with the text
of the latest IERS leap second notice.
Trailing white space has been removed from data file lines, and repeated
spaces in "Rule Jordan" lines in the "asia" file have been converted to
tabs.
