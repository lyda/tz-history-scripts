Message-ID: <75DDD376F2B6B546B722398AC161106C7401FA@nihexchange2.nih.gov>

The files...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2004a.tar.gz
...and...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2004a.tar.gz
...are now available. In addition to the proposed changes circulated on the
time zone mailing list by Paul Eggert, these include the changes to handle
DST transitions that occur at the end of a month in some years but at the
start of the following month in other years (these changes were circulated
back in March). I've also added a copy of the correspondence that's the
basis for claims about DST in the Navajo Nation.
