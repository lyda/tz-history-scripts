Tzcode2004b.tar.gz and tzdata2004b.tar.gz
Message-ID: <75DDD376F2B6B546B722398AC161106C740261@nihexchange2.nih.gov>

The files...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2004b.tar.gz
...and...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2004b.tar.gz
...are now available. These contain the data changes circulated last week on
the time zone mailing list by Paul Eggert--most importantly, they include
updates for Argentina.
I wanted to get these out quickly since they effect present-day operations
down south. I'm holding off (briefly, I hope) on incorporating code changes
until I can do a more thorough review than I have time for just now.
