Message-ID: <B410D30A78C6404C9DABEA31B54A2813066545@nihcesmlbx10.nih.gov>

The files...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2005q.tar.gz
...and...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata200tq.tar.gz
...are now available. Nothing earth-shaking here; as circulated on the
time zone mailing list:
	1.  Electronic mail addresses have been removed.
	2.  Casts of the return value of exit have been removed.
	3.  Casts of the argument of is.* macros have been added.
	4.  Indentation in one section of zic.c has been fixed.
	5.  References to dead URLs in the data files have been dealt
with.

Note that 2005r can be expected before the end of the year with more
minor tweaks.
