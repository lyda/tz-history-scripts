The file...

...is now available; this reflects the Argentina (including San Luis) changes circulated on the time zone mailing list last week (with the correction from Mariano Absatz).

Now that 2009p has all the changes affecting current stamps, I'll be moving on to stuff affecting past and future time stamps. Expect a 2009q next week, but if you're only interested in current stuff, 2009p should do the job.
