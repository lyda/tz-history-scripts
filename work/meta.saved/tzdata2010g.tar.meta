The file...

...is now available, reflecting the changes circulated last week on the time zone mailing list.

Given news received since last Wednesday, I plan to circulate a few more changes (including Pakistan and Tunisia) this coming Wednesday, so data2010h may appear in a week. Those wanting to avoid version thrash may want to wait for data2010h.
