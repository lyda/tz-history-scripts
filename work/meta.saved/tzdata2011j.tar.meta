The file...
	ftp://elsie.nci.nh.gov/pub/tzdata2011j.tar.gz
...is now available; this reflects the changes circulated recently on the times
zone mailing list (contemporary changes for Samoa; past changes for Kenya,
Uganda, and Tanzania); there are also two spelling corrections to comments
in the australasia file (with thanks to Christos Zoulas).

I expect another version will appear soon to handle changes in the
Middle East (and perhaps in Russia); folks seeking to avoid version churn may
want to wait a bit.
