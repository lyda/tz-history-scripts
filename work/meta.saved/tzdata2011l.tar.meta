[tz] tzdata2011l.tar.gz
Message-ID: <9771.1318221722@epsilon.noi.kre.to>

The file ...
	ftp://munnari.oz.au/pub/tzdata2011l.tar.gz
...is now available; this reflects changes circulated last week on the time
zone mailing list.

There are just 2 changes that cause different generated tzdata files from
zic, to Asia/Hebron and Pacific/Fiji - the possible change for Bahia, Brazil
is included, but commented out.  Compared with the diff I sent out last week,
this version also includes attributions for the sources for the changes
(in much the same format as ado used, but the html tags have not been
checked, verified, or used in any way at all, so if there are errors there,
please let me know.)

Unfortunately, there are no signatures, it turns out that I have not
used any form of PGP in so long that getting my keys into a form
where they're usable by gpg is somewhat of a challenge - so most probably
I'll just generate a new key (as was suggested, and which is obviously
the sane approach) for tz distributions - the down side is that at least
initially it isn't going to be signed (trusted) by anyone at all...

To compensate for this lack of signatures, I'm appending (in this message)
a list of digest values, crypto hash function digests generated by a number
of different algorithms (all from the NetBSD pkgsrc "digest" program).
Those ought to give a fair degree of confidence that the tarball has not
been compromised, and by distributing them in this message, essentially
no way for anyone to compromise the digest values (which is the one thing
that a proper signature would ensure).

Lastly, for now, because people seem to be mirroring
	ftp://munnari.oz.au/pub/oldtz/
I have included the current versions of the data & code files there,
as well as their normal home in ftp://munnari.oz.au/pub - previously
the oldtz directory contained only the obsolete tarballs.

But thanks to Joseph S. Myers, the oldtz directory now includes a few
extra archives that I had been missing, including the extremely elusive
tzcode2003b which had been replaced before I even new it existed (and no,
you don't really want it, it contained a fairly serious bug, which is
why it was replaced so quickly...)
