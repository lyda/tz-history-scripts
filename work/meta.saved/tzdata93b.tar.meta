Leap second announcement; updated "leapsecond" file
Message-ID: <9302022003.AA03009@elsie.nci.nih.gov>

A leap second announcement from the USNO is attached;
as well as a shar-format version of an updated "leapseconds" file.

You'll now find "tzdata93b.tar.Z" on elsie.nci.nih.gov; the only change to it
from "tzdata93.tar.Z" is the updated "leapseconds" file.

# @(#)leapseconds	7.6

# Allowance for leapseconds added to each timezone file.

# The International Earth Rotation Service periodically uses leap seconds
# to keep UTC to within 0.9 s of TAI (atomic time); see
# Terry J Quinn, The BIPM and the accurate measure of time,
# Proc IEEE 79, 7 (July 1991), 894-905.
# There were no leap seconds before 1972, because the official mechanism
# accounting for the discrepancy between atomic time and the earth's rotation
# did not exist until the early 1970s.

# The correction (+ or -) is made at the given time, so lines
# will typically look like:
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:60	+	R/S
# or
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:59	-	R/S

# If the leapsecond is Rolling (R) the given time is local time
# If the leapsecond is Stationary (S) the given time is GMT

# Leap	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS	CORR	R/S
