tzcode93e.tar.Z and tzdata93e.tar.Z
Message-ID: <9309060124.AA11939@elsie.nci.nih.gov>

Updated versions of the time zone stuff are available by anonymous ftp from
elsie.nci.nih.gov (128.231.16.1); you'll want the files tzcode93e.tar.Z and
tzdata93e.tar.Z from the "pub" directory.

There's updated data for Israel, England, and Kwajalein; there's also an
update to "zdump" to cope with Kwajalein's 24-hour jump.  Thanks to Paul Eggert
and  Peter Ilieve for the changes.
